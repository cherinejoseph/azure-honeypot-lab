# Azure SOC Honeypot üçØ

In this project, I deployed a Honeypot in Microsft Azure by exposing two virtual machines (Windows & Linux) to the public internet. I then configured a central log repository so logs can be ingested into Log Analytics workspace, which is then used by Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps. I allowed the Honeypot to be exposed to the internet for 24 hours so that I could capture and observe live brute force attack data.

The main objective of this lab is to: 
- collect and analyze logs using KQL
-  Built an attack map workbook to visualize attacker IPs and their countries
-   Create a custom detection rule and responded to a confirmed brute-force attack incident

the two main metrics that I will focus on are:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event log)

## üêù Honeypot?

A **honeypot** is a decoy system made to look vulnerable so attackers interact with it.  
It helps security teams **attract and detect threats, gather intelligence, test defenses, and study real-world attack behavior** without risking production systems.

In this project, the Azure VMs were configured as a honeypot by exposing it to the public internet.  
Attackers attempted brute-force logins, and these events were captured, forwarded, and analyzed in **Microsoft Sentinel**.

## üìå Lab Checklist

1. **Create two virtual machines in Azure (1 Windows, 1 Linux)** - *Honeypot*
   - Opened the VM to the public internet by configuring the **Network Security Group (NSG)** to allow all inbound traffic and Disabling the **Windows Firewall** inside the VM.
   - *I tried to use authentic sounding VM names that would look like real infrastructure to make the honeypot more attractive to attackers. eg. CORP-NET-DEV (for Windows) and CORPNET (for Linux)*

2. **NSG Configuration**  

- Configure the NSG for each vm to allow all onbound traffic.
- Turn off Firewall in windows vm
- Note: The Ubuntu VM firewall (UFW) is disabled by default on most cloud platforms. Network security is handled by the cloud provider (e.g., Azure NSG, AWS Security Group).
- To check the firewall status in linux vm: sudo ufw status
If needed, you can turn it off manually: sudo ufw disable

---

2. **Configure log forwarding**  
   - Set up an **Azure Log Analytics Workspace**  
   - Configured the **Azure Monitoring Agent** to forward security logs from the VM
  
<img width="2870" height="1654" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad6dbfdf-e67b-4ef7-97a6-e90c8381a8c9" />

3. **Connect to a SIEM (Microsoft Sentinel)**  
   - Created a **Microsoft Sentinel** instance  
   - Connected Sentinel to the Log Analytics workspace


### 4. Query failed login attempts (raw logs + SIEM)
- Reviewed raw logs in **Windows Event Viewer** to confirm multiple Event ID **4625** (failed logon) records.
- Ran KQL queries in Sentinel to extract attacker IPs and correlate them with geographic data.

**Windows Event Viewer ‚Äì Multiple Failed Logins:**  
<img width="2574" height="1554" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a53120f-63d4-4b00-9437-613f5c207bc5" />


**KQL Query Output in Sentinel:**

---

We will use these logs to plot this map of where all the different attackers are coming from. In order to do that we need some type of geographic data - Import the spreadsheet we are going to use to resolve IP addresses to actual physical locations on a map.

- Upload the spreadsheet (CSV/XLSX) to Sentinel.
- Create a **Watchlist** from the uploaded file (IP ranges ‚Üí geo metadata).
- Use the watchlist in KQL queries to enrich attacker IPs with country/region data.

### 5. Attack map creation
We will use the logs and the watchlist to visualize attacker locations on a map in Microsoft Sentinel.

**Steps**

1. **Create a new Workbook** in Microsoft Sentinel.  

<img width="1396" height="777" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc2cf5cb-8ffa-467c-a258-bcc2106a2dc1" />

2. **Delete prepopulated elements** and **add a "Query" element**.  

3. **Open the Advanced Editor** tab and paste the workbook JSON.

4. **Observe the workbook ‚Äî verify the query is working correctly.**

5. **Observe map settings ‚Äî configure data source, aggregation, tooltip fields, and time range.**

6. **Observe the final attack map ‚Äî attacker IPs resolved to locations plotted on the map.**

## Conclusion & Lessons Learned

This project provided a practical, end-to-end example of a small SOC pipeline in Azure:
- Deploy a honeypot VM and intentionally expose it to the internet to attract automated scanning and brute-force attempts.
- Forward raw security events to a Log Analytics workspace via the Azure Monitoring Agent.
- Ingest data into Microsoft Sentinel, enrich attacker IPs using a GeoIP watchlist, and visualize activity with a workbook map.

**Key lessons learned**
- Exposed VMs are probed almost immediately ‚Äî even simple lab VMs attract high-volume automated traffic.
- Raw logs (Windows Event Viewer) are the authoritative source; SIEM dashboards and workbooks provide the analysis layer on top of those logs.
- Enrichment (watchlists, threat intel) dramatically improves situational awareness and makes visualizations meaningful.
- Workbooks are flexible and allow you to combine KQL results and watchlists into a single interactive visualization.
-

## Safety, Responsible Use & Cleanup

**Important ‚Äî only run this type of honeypot in an isolated lab environment. Never expose production systems.**

**Before finishing the lab**
- Remove or restrict any public-facing NSG rules that allow all inbound traffic.
- Re-enable the Windows firewall on the VM.
- If you no longer need the VM, **decommission and delete** the VM, associated disks, and public IP to avoid ongoing risk and charges.
- Clean up associated resources: Log Analytics workspace, Sentinel workbook (if desired), and watchlists if not needed.

**Cost & security note**
- Leaving cloud VMs or workspaces running can incur charges and create security risks. Confirm deletion or set up automation to tear down lab resources.

## Next Steps

- Add richer telemetry: enable Sysmon, install EDR agents in a safe lab image, capture network flow logs.
- Create custom Sentinel analytic rules to generate alerts for suspicious patterns (e.g., repeated 4625 from multiple IPs).
- Integrate threat intelligence feeds (AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal) for automated enrichment.
- Build a simple playbook (SOAR) to test automated containment/notification actions in the lab.
